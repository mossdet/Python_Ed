- Add section to software engineering folder  on design patterns in software engineering, covering common patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Decorators and other important patterns. Explain their use cases and how they can improve code maintainability and scalability.

- Based on the course outline in 02_intermediate_level.md, generate the course material for the Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms section, Algorithms subsection (2.2.2). Provide extensive explanation of the concepts. The explanations should be detailed enough to allow self-contained understanding. The explanations should have a M.Sc level.

- Extend the explanation on decorators from file 2_2_1_dsa_data_structures.md, what are decorators, what do they do, how do they work, when are they used, why are they used


# PYTHON PROGRAMMING
- Work step by step and generate the course content exactly as outlined in file python_learning_guide.md. Generate a markdown file for each submodule and then continue with the next submodule. Name each submodule file with the convention Python_Level_ModuleNr_SubModuleNr_SubModuleName, example: Python_Intermediate_1_1_OOP_Fundamentals.md. Make the course content extensive, detailed, intuitive. Provide answers to the Review Questions at the end of each file. Make teh content level comparable to a M.Sc. degree.


# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
- Work step by step and generate the course content exactly as outlined in file software_engineering.md. Generate a markdown file for each submodule and then continue with the next submodule. Name each submodule file with the convention SE_ModuleNr_SubModuleNr_ModuleName, example: SE_1_1_WhatIsSoftwareEngineering.md. Make the course content extensive, detailed, intuitive. Provide answers to the Review Questions at the end of each file. Make teh content level comparable to a M.Sc. degree.
