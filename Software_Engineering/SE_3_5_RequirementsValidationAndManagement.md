## Overview
Requirements validation and management ensure that requirements are correct, complete, and remain aligned with stakeholder needs throughout the project lifecycle. These activities are critical for project success, especially in complex or regulated environments.

## Requirements Validation Techniques
- **Reviews and Inspections:** Systematic examination of requirements by stakeholders and experts to identify errors, ambiguities, and omissions.
- **Prototyping:** Building models or mockups to validate requirements with users.
- **Model Validation:** Using UML or formal models to check logic and completeness.
- **Acceptance Criteria and Test Cases:** Defining clear, testable conditions for each requirement.
- **Traceability Analysis:** Ensuring each requirement is linked to design, code, and tests.
- **Formal Methods:** Mathematical techniques for safety-critical systems (e.g., Z, VDM, Alloy).

## Requirements Change Management
- **Change Control Process:** Formal process for submitting, evaluating, approving, and implementing changes to requirements.
- **Impact Analysis:** Assessing the effects of changes on design, implementation, and testing.
- **Versioning:** Tracking changes and maintaining history of requirements.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Ensuring all affected parties are informed and involved in change decisions.

## Requirements Traceability Matrices
- **Definition:** Tables mapping requirements to design, implementation, and test cases.
- **Purpose:** Support impact analysis, change management, and compliance.
- **Best Practices:** Maintain bidirectional traceability, automate with tools, update regularly.
- **Real-World Example:** Required for ISO 26262 (automotive), DO-178C (aerospace), and FDA (medical devices) compliance.

## Tools for Requirements Management
- **Requirements Management Tools:** IBM DOORS, Jama, ReqIF Studio, Helix RM, JIRA, Azure DevOps.
- **Features:** Traceability, change management, collaboration, reporting, integration with ALM/PLM tools.
- **Automation:** Automated traceability, impact analysis, and reporting.

## Best Practices and Research Trends
- Involve stakeholders in validation and change management.
- Use automated tools for traceability and change tracking.
- Regularly review and update requirements and traceability matrices.
- Research trends: AI-driven validation, automated impact analysis, requirements management in agile/DevOps.

## Review Questions
1. What are the main techniques for validating requirements, and when should each be used?
2. Describe the steps in a formal requirements change management process.
3. How do traceability matrices support requirements management and compliance?
4. List key features of modern requirements management tools.
5. What are best practices for managing requirements in agile and regulated environments?
6. Discuss current research trends in requirements validation and management.

## Answers to Review Questions
1. Reviews/inspections (general), prototyping (user feedback), model validation (complex logic), acceptance criteria/test cases (testability), formal methods (safety-critical).
2. Submit change request → impact analysis → stakeholder review → approval/rejection → update requirements and documentation → communicate changes.
3. Traceability matrices link requirements to design, code, and tests, supporting impact analysis, change management, and regulatory compliance.
4. Traceability, change management, collaboration, reporting, integration, automation.
5. Involve stakeholders, use automated tools, maintain traceability, review/update regularly, tailor process to context.
6. AI-driven validation, automated impact analysis, and requirements management for agile/DevOps are current research trends.
