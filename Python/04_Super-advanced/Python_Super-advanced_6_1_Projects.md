## Custom Python Interpreter
- Design and implement a minimal Python interpreter or subset (e.g., arithmetic expressions, control flow).
- Explore parsing (lex/yacc, ANTLR), bytecode generation, and execution.
- Study CPython's `ceval.c` for reference.
- Challenges: parsing, memory management, error handling, performance.

## Distributed Machine Learning Framework
- Build a scalable ML framework using Dask, Ray, or custom RPC.
- Support distributed training, data sharding, and fault tolerance.
- Integrate with PyTorch/TensorFlow for model execution.
- Challenges: distributed state, synchronization, network failures.

## Real-time Analytics Engine
- Stream processing with Kafka, Flink, or custom event loops.
- Real-time dashboards with WebSockets, async consumers.
- Implement windowing, aggregation, and alerting.
- Challenges: low latency, backpressure, scalability.

## Cryptocurrency Trading Bot
- Connect to exchange APIs (REST, WebSocket, FIX).
- Implement trading strategies, risk management, and backtesting.
- Secure key management and compliance.
- Challenges: latency, market data handling, security.

## Contributing to Major Open Source Projects
- Contribute to CPython, Django, NumPy, Pandas, or other major projects.
- Follow contribution guidelines, participate in code reviews, and attend sprints.
- Benefits: real-world experience, networking, and impact on the Python ecosystem.
