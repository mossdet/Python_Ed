## Introduction to Distributed Systems Patterns

Distributed systems patterns address the unique challenges of building reliable, scalable, and consistent systems across multiple nodes and networks. They are foundational for cloud-native, microservices, and large-scale enterprise architectures.

**Key Concepts:**
- Scalability, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem)
- Coordination, consensus, and distributed state
- Fault tolerance and resilience

**Advanced Perspective:**
- Distributed patterns underpin modern cloud platforms, databases, and global applications.
- Trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance are central to design decisions.

**Critical Thinking Prompt:**
How do distributed systems patterns help balance consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in real-world architectures?

---

## Scalability and Availability Patterns

### Load Balancer Pattern
- **Intent:** Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to balance load and improve availability.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Prevents overload and single points of failure
  - Enables horizontal scaling
- **Python Example:**
```python
def load_balance(request, servers):
    # Simple round-robin
    server = servers[request.id % len(servers)]
    server.handle(request)
```

### Replication Pattern
- **Intent:** Maintain multiple copies of data or services to improve availability and fault tolerance.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Enables failover and disaster recovery
  - Supports read scaling
- **Python Example:**
```python
def replicate(data, replicas):
    for replica in replicas:
        replica.store(data)
```

### Sharding Pattern
- **Intent:** Partition data across multiple nodes to improve scalability and performance.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Reduces contention and bottlenecks
  - Enables linear scaling for large datasets
- **Python Example:**
```python
def get_shard(key, shards):
    return shards[hash(key) % len(shards)]
```

### Leader Election Pattern
- **Intent:** Select a single node as the leader to coordinate actions in a distributed system.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Ensures coordination and consistency
  - Supports failover and recovery
- **Python Example:**
```python
import random
def elect_leader(nodes):
    return random.choice(nodes)
```

---

## Consistency and Coordination Patterns

### Consensus Pattern
- **Intent:** Achieve agreement among distributed nodes on a single value or state (e.g., Paxos, Raft).
- **What it achieves:**
  - Ensures consistency in the presence of failures
  - Enables distributed transactions and state machines
- **Python Example:**
```python
# Pseudocode for consensus
proposals = []
def propose(value):
    proposals.append(value)
    # ...run consensus algorithm...
```

### Distributed Lock Pattern
- **Intent:** Coordinate access to shared resources across nodes, preventing conflicts.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Ensures mutual exclusion
  - Prevents race conditions in distributed environments
- **Python Example:**
```python
import threading
lock = threading.Lock()
def critical_section():
    with lock:
        # ...do work...
        pass
```

### Quorum Pattern
- **Intent:** Require a majority of nodes to agree before committing changes, improving consistency and fault tolerance.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Balances availability and consistency
  - Supports distributed writes and reads
- **Python Example:**
```python
def has_quorum(acks, total):
    return acks > total // 2
```

## Resilience and Fault Tolerance Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Intent:** Prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Improves system stability and recovery
  - Isolates faults and enables fallback
- **Python Example:**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.open = False
    def call(self, func, *args):
        if self.open:
            raise Exception("Circuit open")
        try:
            return func(*args)
        except Exception:
            self.open = True
            raise
```

### Bulkhead Pattern
- **Intent:** Isolate components or resources to prevent failures from spreading.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Limits blast radius of failures
  - Improves overall system resilience
- **Python Example:**
```python
class Bulkhead:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.semaphore = threading.Semaphore(limit)
    def execute(self, func, *args):
        with self.semaphore:
            return func(*args)
```

### Retry Pattern
- **Intent:** Automatically retry failed operations to handle transient faults.
- **What it achieves:**
  - Increases reliability in unreliable networks
  - Supports exponential backoff and error handling
- **Python Example:**
```python
import time
def retry(func, retries=3):
    for i in range(retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception:
            time.sleep(2 ** i)
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Advanced Examples and Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Global E-Commerce Platform
- **Scenario:** A retailer operates across continents, requiring high availability and low latency.
- **Solution:**
  - Use Load Balancer and Sharding for scalability
  - Apply Replication and Quorum for consistency and failover
- **Outcome:** Always-on service, fast response, and robust disaster recovery.

### Case Study 2: Distributed Database System
- **Scenario:** A NoSQL database must support millions of writes per second.
- **Solution:**
  - Use Leader Election and Consensus for coordination
  - Employ Circuit Breaker and Bulkhead for resilience
- **Outcome:** High throughput, strong consistency, and fault isolation.

## Answers and Explanations
1. Replication copies data for availability; Sharding partitions data for scalability.
2. Leader coordinates actions, ensuring consistency and failover.
3. Quorum is used for distributed writes/reads to balance consistency and availability.
4. Circuit Breaker prevents cascading failures and enables recovery.
5. Bulkhead isolates failures, limiting their impact.
6. CAP: Consistency, Availability, Partition Toleranceâ€”can only fully achieve two.
7. Global DB: Sharding for scale, Replication for availability, Quorum for writes.
8. Risks: deadlocks, split-brain, performance bottlenecks.
9. Patterns enable elasticity, resilience, and global distribution.
10. Consensus is hard due to failures, latency, and network partitions.
