## Introduction
This module explores advanced software architecture patterns and design principles for building robust, maintainable, and scalable Python systems. These concepts are essential for large-scale applications and distributed systems.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Focuses on modeling software based on the business domain.
- Key concepts: Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Repositories, Services, Bounded Contexts.
- Encourages close collaboration between developers and domain experts.
- Example: Modeling an e-commerce system with clear domain boundaries (orders, payments, inventory).

## Event-Driven Architecture
- Systems communicate via events (messages) rather than direct calls.
- Promotes loose coupling, scalability, and asynchronous processing.
- Technologies: Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS.
- Example: Order service emits an event when an order is placed; inventory and shipping services react to the event.

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separates read (query) and write (command) operations into different models.
- Enables independent scaling and optimization of reads and writes.
- Often used with event sourcing for auditability.
- Example: Write model updates the database and emits events; read model is updated asynchronously for fast queries.

## Hexagonal Architecture
- Also known as Ports and Adapters.
- Isolates the core business logic from external systems (databases, APIs, UI).
- Promotes testability and flexibility.
- Example: Core logic interacts with interfaces (ports); adapters implement these interfaces for specific technologies.

## Clean Architecture Principles
- Layers: Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, Frameworks & Drivers.
- Dependency rule: Inner layers should not depend on outer layers.
- Emphasizes separation of concerns and independence from frameworks.
- Example: Business rules are at the center, surrounded by adapters for web, database, etc.

## Review Questions
1. What is Domain-Driven Design and why is it important?
2. How does event-driven architecture improve scalability?
3. Explain the concept of CQRS and its benefits.
4. What is hexagonal architecture and how does it promote testability?
5. Describe the main layers of clean architecture.

## Answers to Review Questions
1. DDD models software based on the business domain, improving alignment with business needs and maintainability.
2. Event-driven architecture decouples components, allowing them to scale and evolve independently, and supports asynchronous processing.
3. CQRS separates read and write operations, enabling independent scaling and optimization, and is often used with event sourcing.
4. Hexagonal architecture isolates core logic from external systems via ports and adapters, making it easier to test and swap implementations.
5. Clean architecture consists of entities, use cases, interface adapters, and frameworks/drivers, with dependencies pointing inward to protect business logic.
